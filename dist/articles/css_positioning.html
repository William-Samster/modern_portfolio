   <h1 class="lg-heading">CSS Positioning</h1>
   <h2 class="sm-heading">As I was saying...</h2>
   <p>
     ...this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26979386/css-parents-position-is-absolute-and-childs-position-is-relative-and-vice-ve">article</a>
     really promted me to write this. 
   </p>
   <article>The implication of 'relative' is with respect to 'static', meaning that it takes leave of the document-flow-confines, to assume a <em>computed</em> position. Beginning with the initial coordinates of its static position, this computation takes additional arguments earning a <em>'relative to specification'</em> designation. We may now ascribe <code>top|right|bottom|left</code> factors. <br>
    But there are actually a few things that happen:
    <ul>
      <li>ability to shift an element around based on its regular position</li>
      <li>it introduces the ability to use z-index on that element, which doesn't really work with statically positioned elements. (Even if you don't set a z-index value, this element will now appear on top of any other statically positioned element. You can't fight it by setting a higher z-index value on a statically positioned element.)</li>
      <li>it limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements</li>
      <li>I need to confirm this one, but it seems that it will prevent the following element to position itself relative. This needs research.</li>
    </ul>
   This ability dismisses the mistaken notion that...<br>
   <q>...relative is a little weird because it really affects that element's children, not it's own position. It's just saying to it's child elements, "position yourself relative to me if you have <code>position: absolute</code>.</q><br> 
   The ability to position a child element with 'relation' to the <em>'relative-element'</em> which is achieved by setting the parent's position to relative, leads to the above conclusion. Which is awkwardly done by ascribing the 'absolute' position to the child. However, as a fellow has mentioned in the comments, this is obvious not the intention. What the commentator missed here was the true intuition behind this construct. 
   <p>Try this:</p>
   <code>
    <p>
      .container{
        position:relative;
        width:90vw;
        height: 90vh;
        border: 3px solid steelblue;
        margin: auto;
      }
    </p>
    <p>
      .element{
        position: static;
        top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
        margin: auto;
        background: tomato;
        width: 50vw; height: 50vh;
      }
    </p>
      <p>
        .container2{
        position: relative;
        top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
        width:40vw;
        height: 40vh;
        border: 3px solid steelblue;
        margin: auto;
      }
    </p>
    
    <p>
      .element2{
        position: absolute;
        border: 3px solid steelblue;
        top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
        margin: auto;
        background: tomato;
        width: 20vw; 
        height: 20vh;
      }
    </p>
    
    <p>
      /* just aesthetics */
      body{
        height: 100vh;
        display:flex;
        background: azure;
      }
    </p>

   <p>If you toy around with the above example you will see the rationale of the naming convention. If you notice, when setting the 2nd to static (or initial) or even relative, it will not use the parent 
    <p>
      What bothers me still is the {relative, static|relative|absolute, relative, absolute} combo, where the last element seems to skip the immediate parent and position according to the <em>first</em> relative element! <br>
      Here's my theory for now: An <code>'absolute'</code> affix <em>needs</em> a direct anchor to the <em>original</em> document-flow. Either with a 'bonafide' <code>static</code> or a <code>relative</code> element, being that the <code>relative</code> features an original doc-flow factor, as we have explained. A <code>'relative'</code> which succeeds a <code>'relative'</code> or even a <q>reset</q> <code>static</code> (i.e. using 'initial' or forced 'static' after a ) is a pseudo doc-flow and not a genuine doc-placement, the absolute will look to the next level.
      Furthermore, observing the last element, with {relative, absolute, relative, absolute} it will position to the absolute! whereas, {relative, static, relative, absolute} that last absolute element will revert to the first relative!
    </p>
     <br>Breaking from the non-computed 'static' position, <em>'relative'</em> is a <em>function-construct</em> accepting declared values. (For this reason, placing an additional construct <em>immediately after</em> the first, i.e. <code>relative > relative</code>, will not feed the second function with arguments). <code>'absolute'</code> however, does not look for values but detects a physical position.
   (with relation to 'relative'), initial (sets to defaults), fixed (irrespective of scrolling...)</p>
   <p>
     So, 
     <ul>
       <li>The only reason you would ever set an element to position: static; is to forcefully remove some positioning that got applied to an element outside of your control. This is fairly rare, as positioning doesn't cascade.</li>
       <li></li>
       <li></li>
       <li></li>
       <li></li>
     </ul>
   </p>
